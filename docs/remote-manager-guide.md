# Remote Manager operator guide

The game reads its live configuration from:

`https://georgi-cole.github.io/bbmobilenew/config/live-config.json`

Released clients check at startup and refresh every five minutes. If the file is temporarily unavailable, the last valid cached configuration is used; bundled defaults remain the final fallback.

## Open the control panel

1. Open the deployed game with `#/remote-manager?debug=1&qa=1` at the end of its URL.
2. The first successful QA visit remembers access on that browser. You can also open **Remote Manager** from the QA Control Center afterward.
3. The panel loads the currently published JSON. Changes made in the form are only a local draft until you publish them.

## One-time GitHub setup

Create a fine-grained personal access token in GitHub, restricted to the `georgi-cole/bbmobilenew` repository.

- Repository permission **Contents: Read and write** is required to update the JSON file.
- Repository permission **Pull requests: Read and write** is required for the recommended review-PR flow.
- Give the token a short expiration and revoke it if it is ever shared.

Paste the token into the Publish tab when needed. The panel keeps it only in the current browser tab and never saves it in the repository, JSON, or local storage.

## Common operations

### Send a message to everyone

1. Open **Broadcast**.
2. Enable “Show this message to all players.”
3. Enter a title and message; choose Critical only for urgent notices.
4. Optionally schedule start and end times.
5. Open **Publish** and choose **Create review PR**.
6. Review and merge the PR on GitHub. GitHub Pages deploys the new file, and active clients pick it up within about five minutes.
7. To remove the message, disable it and publish again.

### Replace a music track

1. Host the audio at a public HTTPS URL that permits browser playback.
2. Open **Music**, choose **Add track override**, select the semantic game track, and paste the URL.
3. Set volume between 0 and 1 and publish.
4. Remove the override and publish again to return to the bundled track.

### Schedule a competition

1. Open **Game**, enable remote competition rules, and add a rule.
2. Choose whether it matches a day or remaining-player count, and whether it applies to LOH, POS, or either.
3. Choose a random game, category, or exact game.
4. Leave the winner on “Play normally,” choose a random winner, or enter an exact player ID.
5. Use priority when multiple rules can match; higher numbers win.
6. Publish. Protected twist rules and participant eligibility still take precedence.

### Tune Season Director orchestration

The **Advanced JSON** configuration can manage the `director` policy used for new seasons.

- `doubleElimination.seasonChance` controls whether the season reserves its single Double Elimination; `minPlayers` / `maxPlayers` control the activation window.
- `specialSafety` controls the mid/late-game Safety window and weighted selection between Double Trouble, Halo Exchange, Detox, and Force Majeure.
- `secretMissions`, `morningShock`, and AI-only `battleBack` have their own season-level frequencies and roster windows.
- The human Battle Back path is separate: only a human who reached the Tribunal (`status: jury`) can receive the guaranteed return opportunity. Pre-Tribunal eliminations remain final and never enter the Battle Back candidate pool.
- Twin Shock remains a one-time lifetime special. It does not consume the ordinary shock budget and is only permanently consumed after its storyline resolves.

Frequency, weight, and roster-window changes are **snapshotted when a new season starts**. Publishing those values does not rewrite an in-progress season. The `director.killSwitches` fields are the exception: they are checked live and can immediately stop a not-yet-started mechanic if a production issue is discovered.

To tune the Director, edit the `director` object in **Advanced JSON**, validate it, then publish through a review PR or directly to main. Released clients refresh the live configuration on the normal five-minute cadence.


### Tune The Big Eye Confessional

Use Advanced JSON to manage the versioned confessional databank. Increment confessional.revision whenever you change character/content tuning so QA can identify the exact bank used by a report.

The remotely tunable groups are: features (memory callbacks, proactive observations, deterministic knowledge, visual reactions, predictions and Challenge Me); persona; comprehension vocabulary/slang; responses.intents and challenge prompts; salience weights/templates; and director character tuning used by the generative backends.

Validate and apply JSON before publishing. Unknown or invalid fields are removed, known values are merged over bundled defaults, and no remote field can execute game logic. Character/content changes can therefore ship through the normal live-config deployment without a mobile-store release.

### Tune Social/Drama energy

1. Open **Social**.
2. Change weekly energy or caps for normal and drama modes.
3. Update the revision note so the change is easy to identify.
4. Publish. Existing games use the refreshed settings when the runtime reads the social configuration.

## Publishing choices

- **Create review PR** is recommended. It creates a branch and PR, and nothing goes live until that PR is merged.
- **Publish directly to main** is for urgent changes. It commits immediately and starts the normal GitHub Pages deployment.

Publishing is not instant: wait for the Pages workflow to finish, then allow up to five minutes for an already-open game to refresh. A newly opened game fetches the current file immediately.

## Advanced JSON

The Advanced JSON tab supports the complete validated remote schema, including detailed music assignments, social text/policies, Confessional character/comprehension data, themes, player presentation overrides, and rollout controls. **Validate and apply JSON** removes unknown or unsafe fields before publishing. No remote field is executed as code.
