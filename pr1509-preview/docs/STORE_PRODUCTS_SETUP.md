# Store products release setup

The release includes seven permanent, one-time products for iOS and Android.
Every released product must be configured as **non-consumable** in Apple App Store Connect and
as a **one-time, non-consumable product** in Google Play Console.

## Before creating the store listings

The permanent iOS, Android, and Capacitor identifier is
`com.georgicole.thebigeye`. Confirm that this exact ID is available in both
developer consoles before uploading the first release; changing it later creates
a different app.

Tribunal Mode and No Ads remain reserved in code but are hidden from the 1.0
store. Do not create or activate those products until Tribunal gameplay and a
real advertising integration are present and tested.

## Product identifiers

Use the same IDs on both platforms:

| Product            | Product ID                                   | Grants                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| The Big Eye VIP    | `com.georgicole.thebigeye.vip`               | All current standalone unlocks and VIP themes |
| Survival Mode      | `com.georgicole.thebigeye.survival`          | Survival Mode only                            |
| Public Mode        | `com.georgicole.thebigeye.publicmode`        | Public Mode only                              |
| Reality Mode       | `com.georgicole.thebigeye.dramamode`         | Reality Mode only                             |
| Cupid's Arrow      | `com.georgicole.thebigeye.cupidarrow`        | Cupid's Arrow seasonal expansion              |
| Vox Populi         | `com.georgicole.thebigeye.voxpopuli`         | Vox Populi seasonal expansion                 |
| Premium Challenges | `com.georgicole.thebigeye.premiumchallenges` | Remastered Find Your Twin 1 & 2               |

The IDs can be overridden with the matching `VITE_*_PRODUCT_ID` values in the
platform environment files. The app always displays the localized title and
price returned by Apple or Google.

Set the VIP price below the combined price of the standalone products.
VIP is a permanent bundle, not a subscription.

## Apple App Store Connect

1. Accept the Paid Apps agreement and complete banking and tax information.
2. Under the app's In-App Purchases, create the seven released products as
   **Non-Consumable**.
3. Add localization, price, review screenshot, and review notes to each product.
4. In Xcode, confirm that the app target has the In-App Purchase capability.
5. Test purchases and Restore Purchases with StoreKit local testing and App
   Store Sandbox accounts.
6. Submit the products for review with the app version that first exposes them.

## Google Play Console

1. Complete the payments profile.
2. Under Monetize > Products > In-app products, create all seven released IDs.
3. Make each product active and assign its one-time price.

5. Add license testers and test purchase, pending payment, refund, reinstall,
   and restore behavior.

## Native project sync

After installing dependencies or changing the web app, run:

```powershell
npm run sync:android
npm run sync:ios
```

The Android manifest includes the Play Billing permission. On iOS, open the
project in Xcode and confirm the In-App Purchase capability before archiving.

## Production verification

The client checks StoreKit current entitlements on iOS and currently owned,
acknowledged products on Google Play. Ownership is cached so permanent unlocks
remain available offline and is reconciled after the next successful store
refresh.

Before public release, add server-side purchase verification and store
notifications so refunds and account changes are authoritative even when the
app is not opened. The purchase bridge exposes the Android purchase token and
Apple StoreKit receipt/JWS needed by that backend.

## Release checklist

- Add working Privacy Policy and Terms of Use links to the store listing and
  purchase screen before review.
- Test purchase, restore, pending payment, refund, reinstall, account switching,
  and offline launch on physical iOS and Android devices.
- Confirm VIP grants every standalone entitlement and VIP-only themes.
- Confirm each standalone purchase grants only its advertised feature.
- Remove `VITE_VIP_DEV_ENTITLEMENT=true` from every release environment.
