# Active minigame test matrix

## How this stays complete

This matrix covers every non-retired registry entry. Its executable source is `tests/helpers/minigameQualityMatrix.ts`. The completeness test compares its keys with `getPoolByFilter({ retired: false })`, verifies cited files exist, and checks that every active key appears in this document.

Evidence codes: **L** logic/rules, **C** real component, **H** host/integration, **B** registry-driven Playwright. ?B configured? means a browser path exists; only `docs/quality-phase-2-report.md` may claim it passed after execution.

## Contracts common to every row

| Field              | Current contract                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Supported modes    | Season competition through MinigameHost and registry-backed Minigame Lab. The surrounding season engine decides LOH/POS or special-prize context. |
| Human path         | The real interactive React component is mounted by MinigameHost.                                                                                  |
| AI path            | Seeded competition AI supplies participant results under the same ranking contract.                                                               |
| Spectator path     | Host/spectator outcome uses the same participants and authoritative-result contract; dedicated presentation varies by game.                       |
| Partial completion | Exit is visible as partial and explicit Continue is required before parent acceptance.                                                            |
| Retry/dismissal    | Retry resets one attempt; dismissal, rerender, and late callbacks cannot commit twice.                                                            |
| Result shape       | Authoritative games return a finite value and participant-owned winner; raw games return a finite human value for host ranking.                   |
| Season effects     | Result, announcement, reward, history, and phase transition are applied exactly once by the parent.                                               |

Except for `gridOfLuck` (explicitly 2?4), the registry currently omits game-specific participant bounds. The runtime default is minimum 1 with no registry maximum, while the QA lab constrains interactive previews to 2?12. This is recorded as a shared design gap; the matrix does not pretend the default is a verified game-specific maximum.

?Owned? means the component has no registry-wide timeout; its round state machine owns timing. Late timers still cannot overwrite an accepted result.

## Interpretation

`quickTapSeasons` is covered by the same seeded AI-audit contract as the original Quick Tap game, with its season modifiers documented in the registry quality profile.
`castleRescue2` is the second registry variant of Castle Rescue and shares the documented ranking and continuation contract.

The catalog proves registry completeness and keeps the known evidence/gaps visible. It does not upgrade ?configured? browser checks to executed protection. Phase 2 is complete only after the final report records actual browser projects, viewports, repetitions, artifacts, and any remaining exceptions.
