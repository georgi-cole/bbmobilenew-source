## Scoring Events & Default Points

| Event                               | Points (default) | Where recorded                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LOH competition win                 | +10 per win      | `applyLohWinner()` in `gameSlice.ts`                                                                                                                  |
| POS competition win                 | +8 per win       | `applyPosWinner()` in `gameSlice.ts`                                                                                                                  |
| Made jury                           | +5               | `buildArchive()` in `GameOver.tsx` — `status === 'jury'` (winner/runner-up excluded)                                                                  |
| Battle Back win (returned to house) | +8 per win       | `completeBattleBack()` in `gameSlice.ts`                                                                                                              |
| Survived double eviction week       | +7               | `survivedDoubleEviction` flag on `PlayerSeasonSummary` — **not yet auto-detected**; requires game logic to tag double-eviction weeks (see note below) |
| Survived triple eviction week       | +10              | `survivedTripleEviction` flag on `PlayerSeasonSummary` — **not yet auto-detected** (see note below)                                                   |
| Won Public's Favorite Player        | +25              | `buildArchive()` — reads `favoritePlayer.winnerId`                                                                                                    |
| Won the game (Season Winner)        | +100             | `buildArchive()` — `finalPlacement === 1`                                                                                                             |
| Runner-up                           | +50              | `buildArchive()` — `finalPlacement === 2`                                                                                                             |
| Won Final LOH (Part 3 of Final 3)   | +15              | `applyF3MinigameWinner()` / `advance()` final3_comp3 path                                                                                             |

> **Note — double/triple eviction detection**: The `survivedDoubleEviction` and
> `survivedTripleEviction` fields are defined on `PlayerSeasonSummary` and the scoring
> weights are in place, but the game engine does not yet automatically detect multi-eviction
> weeks. To award these points, a future change should: (1) tag each eviction week with an
> eviction count in `SeasonArchive.doubleEvictionWeeks` / `tripleEvictionWeeks`, and (2) set
> the corresponding boolean flags in `buildSummaries()` by checking whether the player was
> alive at the end of such a week. Until then, both fields default to `false` and produce 0
> points.

### Special Rule — Won Both Public's Favorite AND the Game

When the **same player** wins both the game (`finalPlacement === 1`) and the Public's Favorite Player vote (`wonPublicFavorite === true`), their combined award for those two events is **50 points total** — NOT the sum of 100 + 25.

This is implemented in `computeScoreBreakdown()` in `src/scoring/computeLeaderboard.ts`. The `wonBothGameAndFavorite` weight (default **50**) replaces both `wonGame` and `wonPublicFavorite` in this case.

## Architecture

### Scoring module (`src/scoring/`)

| File                    | Purpose                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `types.ts`              | `ScoringWeights` and `ScoreBreakdown` interfaces                                     |
| `weights.ts`            | `DEFAULT_WEIGHTS` constant and `mergeWeights()` helper                               |
| `computeLeaderboard.ts` | `computeScoreBreakdown()`, `computeLeaderboardScore()`, `computeSeasonLeaderboard()` |
| `computeAllTime.ts`     | `computeAllTimeLeaderboard()` — aggregates across season archives                    |

All compute functions are **pure** (no side effects, no Redux dependency) and accept an optional `weights` parameter so both client and server can produce consistent scores.

### Raw stat fields on `PlayerSeasonSummary`

`PlayerSeasonSummary` (in `src/store/seasonArchive.ts`) stores the raw boolean/integer data:

| Field                    | Type      | Description                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `lohWins`                | `number`  | LOH competition wins this season                                                           |
| `posWins`                | `number`  | POS competition wins this season                                                           |
| `timesNominated`         | `number`  | Times nominated for eviction                                                               |
| `madeJury`               | `boolean` | Reached jury house (status `'jury'`; excludes winner and runner-up)                        |
| `battleBackWins`         | `number`  | Battle Back competition wins                                                               |
| `survivedDoubleEviction` | `boolean` | Survived a double-eviction week — must be set manually until auto-detection is implemented |
| `survivedTripleEviction` | `boolean` | Survived a triple-eviction week — must be set manually until auto-detection is implemented |
| `wonPublicFavorite`      | `boolean` | Won America's Favorite Player vote                                                         |
| `wonFinalHoh`            | `boolean` | Won the Final LOH (Part 3 of Final 3)                                                      |
| `weeksAlive`             | `number`  | Weeks survived in the house                                                                |
| `leaderboardScore`       | `number`  | Pre-computed total (for display without recompute)                                         |

Fields missing from older archives are treated as `0` / `false` in all compute functions.

### Stat increment locations (no double-counting)

Stats are incremented **exactly once**, at the authoritative mutation site:

- **`lohWins`** — `applyLohWinner()` helper (called by `completeMinigame`, `applyMinigameWinner`, and `advance()` loh_results).
- **`posWins`** — `applyPosWinner()` helper (called by `completeMinigame`, `applyMinigameWinner`, and `advance()` pos_results).
- **`timesNominated`** — `finalizeNominations`, `commitNominees` (human paths) and the `nomination_results` case of `advance()` (AI path). Replacement nominee paths also call `incrementTimesNominated()`: `setReplacementNominee` (human LOH), `submitPovSaveTarget` AI branch, and `aiReplacementStep === 2` in `advance()`. All paths use the shared `incrementTimesNominated()` helper.
- **`battleBackWins`** — `completeBattleBack()` reducer.
- **`wonFinalHoh`** — `markFinalHohWinner()` helper, called from `advance()` `final3_comp3` and `applyF3MinigameWinner()` `final3_comp3_minigame`.

---

## Tuning Weights

Override individual weights without modifying the defaults using `mergeWeights()`:

```ts
import { mergeWeights, DEFAULT_WEIGHTS } from './src/scoring/weights'
import { computeSeasonLeaderboard } from './src/scoring/computeLeaderboard'

const customWeights = mergeWeights({
  perLohWin: 15, // increase LOH value
  madeJury: 10, // increase jury value
})

const leaderboard = computeSeasonLeaderboard(summaries, customWeights)
```

`mergeWeights` does **not** mutate `DEFAULT_WEIGHTS`.

---

## Server Path

`archivePersistence.ts` exposes an `enabled` flag:

```ts
export let enabled = true // set to false to disable localStorage
```

When `enabled = false`, `saveSeasonArchives` is a no-op and `loadSeasonArchives` returns `undefined`. To swap in a server backend:

1. Set `enabled = false` in `archivePersistence.ts`.
2. Implement `saveSeasonArchives` / `loadSeasonArchives` as async wrappers calling your API.
3. Pass `weights` from server config to `computeSeasonLeaderboard` / `computeAllTimeLeaderboard` so scores are identical on client and server.

---

## Migration Notes

Archives created before the scoring system was introduced may be missing the new fields (`lohWins`, `posWins`, `madeJury`, etc.). All compute functions treat missing fields as `0` / `false`, so older archives will simply show a score of `0` until they are replayed or manually backfilled.
