/**
 * Central per-minigame AI score balance configuration.
 *
 * This is the single authoritative location for tuning AI score distributions.
 * Edit entries here whenever AI scores feel unrealistic — no other file needs
 * to change for a pure balancing adjustment.
 *
 * Shape:
 *   scoreBands   — weighted probability bands; chances must sum to 1.0.
 *   jitter       — small ±N random offset applied after band selection.
 *   hotStreakChance / hotStreakBonusMin / hotStreakBonusMax
 *                — occasional burst above the rolled band score.
 *   slumpChance  / slumpPenaltyMin / slumpPenaltyMax
 *                — occasional dip below the rolled band score.
 *
 * Only games that need custom band-based scoring need an entry here.
 * Games handled by the generic simulateAiPerformance() path do not require
 * an entry (their model data lives in minigameAiRegistry.ts).
