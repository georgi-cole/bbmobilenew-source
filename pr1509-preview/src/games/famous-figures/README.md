# Famous Figures

A Big Brother-style trivia minigame where players identify famous pop-culture figures and characters from progressive clues. Sister game to **Biography Blitz**.

## Game Rules

1. A famous figure or character is hidden — you see only an initial "clue" sentence.
2. You can request up to **5 hints**, each more specific than the last.
3. Type your guess at any time — fuzzy matching accepts reasonable spelling variants.
4. **Scoring:** fewer hints used = higher score.
   | Hints used | Points |
   |------------|--------|
   | 0 (base clue only) | **10** |
   | 1 | 9 |
   | 2 | 7 |
   | 3 | 5 |
   | 4 | 3 |
   | 5 | 1 |
   | Overtime | 1 |
5. **Three rounds** per match. Highest cumulative score wins.
6. **Tiebreaker:** most correct rounds. If still tied, the first tied player wins.

## Per-player Progression

Each player gets their own **unique, reproducible** shuffled figure queue for the match.

- Built at match start via `mulberry32(seed ^ fnv1a32(playerId))`.
- Each player guesses a **different** figure from every other player in the same round.
- A player's **personal round cursor** (`playerRoundCursor`) increments immediately on
  each correct guess, independently of the global round timer.
- When a player's cursor reaches `totalRounds` before the match ends, they see a
  personal **"waiting for others"** screen displaying their per-round breakdown and a
  live scoreboard until the global match completes.

### Key state fields

| Field                       | Type                       | Description                                                          |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `playerFigureQueues`        | `Record<string, number[]>` | Per-player list of figure indices (length = `totalRounds`)           |
| `playerRoundCursor`         | `Record<string, number>`   | How many rounds each player has solved so far (0…`totalRounds`)      |
| `playerPersonalRoundScores` | `Record<string, number[]>` | Points earned per solved round, written immediately on correct guess |

Use `getPlayerFigureIndex(state, playerId, round)` to resolve the correct figure index for any player and round.

## Hint System

Hints are revealed one at a time; requesting more reduces the points available.

| Index | Source             | Content                                                                                |
| ----- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Dataset `hints[0]` | Vague — no direct identifying information                                              |
| 1     | Dataset `hints[1]` | General field or era                                                                   |
| 2     | Dataset `hints[2]` | More specific behavior, role, or relationship                                          |
| 3     | Dataset `hints[3]` | Strong signature trait, object, catchphrase, or context                                |
| 4     | Dataset `hints[4]` | Near-giveaway clue such as a rival, companion, title link, or final identifying detail |

> **Note:** All five dataset hints are shown at runtime. `getHintText` only falls back to generated name clues if an older row is missing a late hint.

## Dataset Format (JSON Schema)

Each figure in `src/games/famous-figures/data/famous_figures.json` follows this schema:

```json
{
  "canonicalName": "Mickey Mouse",
  "normalizedName": "mickey mouse",
  "acceptedAliases": ["Mickey", "Mickey Mouse"],
  "normalizedAliases": ["mickey", "mickey mouse"],
  "hints": [
    "Hint 1 — vague, no direct identifying info",
    "Hint 2 — general field or era",
    "Hint 3 - more specific behavior or relationship",
    "Hint 4 - strong signature trait or context",
    "Hint 5 - near-giveaway final clue"
  ],
  "baseClueFact": "A single sentence shown as the initial clue.",
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "category": "artist",
  "era": "Renaissance"
}
```

## Alias Rules

An alias is a recognisable alternative form of the name. Good aliases:

- **Mononyms** — single-name recognition (`"Mozart"`, `"Michelangelo"`)
- **Shortened forms** — omit first or last name (`"Einstein"`, `"Darwin"`)
- **Regnal names** — title-only forms used historically (`"Caesar"`)
- **Honorific forms** — `"Mahatma Gandhi"` (Mohandas Gandhi's honorific)
- **Abbreviations** — `"MLK"` for Martin Luther King Jr

All aliases and the canonical name must have a corresponding pre-computed `normalizedAlias` (the output of `normalizeForMatching`). Always regenerate normalized forms when adding or modifying a figure.

---

## Fuzzy Matching

The fuzzy matcher is in `src/games/famous-figures/fuzzy.ts`.

### Normalisation (`normalizeForMatching`)

1. NFD Unicode decomposition → strip combining diacritics (removes accents)
2. Replace apostrophes/elision marks (`'`, `'`, `` ` ``) with spaces
3. Lowercase
4. Strip non-alphanumeric/space characters (punctuation, hyphens)
5. Remove standalone particles: `de da del di von van al ibn el of the d l`
6. Collapse whitespace

**Examples:**

| Input                 | Normalised        |
| --------------------- | ----------------- |
| `Galileo Galilei`     | `galileo galilei` |
| `Leonardo da Vinci`   | `leonardo vinci`  |
| `Joan of Arc`         | `joan arc`        |
| `Jeanne d'Arc`        | `jeanne arc`      |
| `Alexander the Great` | `alexander great` |
| `Nikola Tesla`        | `nikola tesla`    |

### Damerau-Levenshtein Distance

Full **Damerau-Levenshtein** distance (not restricted). Transpositions count as a single edit (e.g. `"enistein"` → `"einstein"` = 1 edit).

### Acceptance threshold

- If the normalised alias length **≤ 4**: require **exact match** (prevents short strings like `"MLK"` accepting `"MLJ"`).
- Otherwise: accept if DL distance ≤ `Math.max(1, Math.floor(aliasLength × 0.22))`.

## How to Add / Modify Figures

1. Open `src/games/famous-figures/data/famous_figures.json`.
2. Add a new object following the JSON schema above.
3. **Manually compute** `normalizedName` and `normalizedAliases` using `normalizeForMatching`:
   ```ts
   import { normalizeForMatching } from 'src/games/famous-figures/fuzzy'
   console.log(normalizeForMatching('Joan of Arc')) // → "joan arc"
   ```
4. Write all five hints as a gradual ladder: broad category, general relationship or world, behavior or role, strong signature trait, then a near-giveaway final clue.
5. Run tests: `npm run test:famous-figures`

AI contestants also have stable general-knowledge profiles and deterministic figure-specific familiarity. This allows strong players to answer recognizable figures early while preserving occasional blind spots, specialist solves, hesitation, and correct answers after four or five hints.

---

## Edge Cases

### Mononyms

Figures known by a single name (e.g. Michelangelo, Mozart, Cleopatra):

- The `canonicalName` is the mononym and is **always a direct match target** — you do not need to add it to `acceptedAliases`.
- Only add the mononym to `acceptedAliases` / `normalizedAliases` if you also want to list alternative spellings or variants of the mononym itself.
- Short mononyms (≤4 chars) are matched by **exact** spelling only (no fuzzy distance allowed).
- Mononym entries still need five curated hints; generated name clues are only a fallback for incomplete legacy rows.

### Regnal and title names

- Caesar (alias for Julius Caesar), Gandhi (for Mahatma Gandhi).
- Place the short form in `acceptedAliases` so it is matched against directly.

### Particles in names

The normaliser strips `de`, `da`, `del`, `di`, `von`, `van`, `al`, `ibn`, `el`, `of`, `the`, `d`, `l`. Pre-compute all `normalizedName`/`normalizedAliases` fields using the normaliser function to ensure accuracy.

### Diacritics

The normaliser strips all combining diacritics via NFD decomposition. `Cleopâtra`, `Gàlilëo`, `Góngora` all normalise without accents.

## Admin Fallback Notes

- The 200-figure dataset is embedded in the bundle; no server fetch is required.
- If a figure at index N is somehow missing (programming error), the relevant `submitPlayerGuess` call silently no-ops.
- Seed-based figure shuffling ensures reproducible round order across page reloads.
- Per-player queues are built with `mulberry32(seed ^ fnv1a32(playerId))` — reproducible but unique per player.
