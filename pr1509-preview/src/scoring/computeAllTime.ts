 * computed with `computeScoreBreakdown` and summed into a single
 * `AllTimeEntry` per player.  Results are sorted descending by `totalScore`.
 *
 * Archives created before the scoring system was introduced (missing fields)
 * are handled gracefully: missing numeric fields default to 0, missing
 * boolean fields default to false.
 *
 * @param archives   All completed season archives (any order).
 * @param weights    Optional scoring weights; defaults to DEFAULT_WEIGHTS.
