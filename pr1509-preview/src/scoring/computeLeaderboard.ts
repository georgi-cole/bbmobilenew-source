 *   When the player both won the game (finalPlacement === 1) and the
 *   Public's Favorite Player vote, `winBonus` is set to
 *   `weights.wonBothGameAndFavorite` (50 by default) instead of the

 *   requirement: "Won both Public's Favorite and the Game: 50 points total".

 * @param summary   Per-player archive data for one completed season.
 * @param weights   Optional scoring weights; defaults to DEFAULT_WEIGHTS.
