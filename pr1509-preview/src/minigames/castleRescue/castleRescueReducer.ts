/**
 * castleRescueReducer.ts
 *
 * Plain (non-Redux) reducer for Castle Rescue RunState.
 * Designed to be used with React's useReducer:
 *
 *   const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(castleRescueReducer, createInitialRunState());
 *
 * The platformer game component manages its own canvas state directly;
 * this reducer is provided for external competition-system wiring that
 * needs to track the run lifecycle (start time, finalization, reset).
