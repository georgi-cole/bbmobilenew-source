/**
 * castleRescueTypes.ts
 *
 * All TypeScript interfaces and type aliases for the Castle Rescue minigame.
 * No runtime logic lives here — pure type definitions only.
 *
 * This file exports two groups of types:
 *
 * 1. **Platformer game types** (primary): Public data contracts for the
 *    platformer-style version of Castle Rescue. These describe the shape of
 *    level geometry, physics-related data, and competition integration as seen
 *    by callers. Internal runtime structures in the platformer engine may use
 *    different field names or helper types, with conversion handled elsewhere.
 *
 * 2. **Legacy grid types** (deprecated): Used internally by the grid-based
 *    pipe-selection engine, selectors, and test fixtures. New code should
 *    prefer the platformer types as the external/public schema.

 *  rescuing       – Princess rescued; brief celebration animation.
 *  timeout        – Timer expired before princess was rescued.
 *  results        – Score / results screen shown to the player.
