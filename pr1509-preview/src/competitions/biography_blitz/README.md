# Biography Blitz Competition

A trivia-style elimination minigame for _Big Brother Mobile_. Contestants answer questions about each other's houseguest biographies; wrong answers mean elimination. The last contestant standing wins the HOH or POV.

---

## How it works

1. All active contestants see the same question each round.
2. **Avatar mode** (default when dynamic bio questions are available): a grid of all active contestants' avatars is shown; players tap the avatar of the person they think answers the question.
3. **Text-button mode** (fallback when dynamic generation fails): standard A/B/C/D answer buttons.
4. Contestants who answer incorrectly are eliminated at the end of the round.
5. If _everyone_ answers incorrectly the round is voided and no one is eliminated.
6. The last surviving contestant is declared the winner.

## Hot Streak mechanic

A contestant who wins **2 consecutive rounds** earns a **Hot Streak** bonus for the _next round only_:

- Their avatar tile in the contestant strip shows a 🔥 flame icon.
- One provably-wrong avatar in the answer grid is visually dimmed for that player only (`bb-blitz__avatar-btn--bonus-hint` CSS class).
- The bonus never reveals the correct answer — only rules out one impossible choice.
- The bonus is consumed after one round (whether or not it was used).
- If the streak owner is eliminated the streak is cleared immediately.

## Configuration flags

Both flags are passed in the `startBiographyBlitz` Redux action payload:

| Flag               | Type                       | Default | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `testMode`         | `boolean`                  | `false` | Collapses all animation delays and the 15 s human timeout to near-zero for CI / unit tests.                                  |
| `dynamicQuestions` | `BiographyBlitzQuestion[]` | `[]`    | Pre-generated question bank from live houseguest bios. Falls back to the static `BIOGRAPHY_BLITZ_QUESTIONS` bank when empty. |

The component also accepts a `testMode` prop which is OR'd with the Redux flag.

## Wiring with MinigameHost

The competition is registered in `src/minigames/registry.ts` under the key `biographyBlitz` with:

```ts
implementation: 'react',
reactComponentKey: 'BiographyBlitz',
authoritative: true,
scoringAdapter: 'authoritative',
category: 'trivia',
```

`MinigameHost` routes the `BiographyBlitz` key to `<BiographyBlitzComp>` directly (not through the generic `reactComponents` map), passing `participantIds`, `participants`, `prizeType`, `seed`, and `onComplete`.

The outcome thunk `resolveBiographyBlitzOutcome` dispatches `applyMinigameWinner` exactly once, guarded by the `outcomeResolved` flag.
