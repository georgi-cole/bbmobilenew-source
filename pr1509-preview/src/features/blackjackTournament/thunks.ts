/**
 * Thunk: resolveBlackjackTournamentOutcome
 *
 * Reads the completed Blackjack Tournament state, validates the current game
 * phase matches the competition type, and awards LOH or POS via
 * `applyMinigameWinner`.
 *
 * Mirrors the resolveBiographyBlitzOutcome pattern:
 *  - Idempotent: no-op if outcomeResolved is already true.
 *  - Phase-guarded: logs an error and returns if the game phase does not match
 *    the competition type (prevents accidental cross-phase dispatch).
