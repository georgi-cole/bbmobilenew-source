/**
 * Redux slice for the "Tilt Labyrinth" scored minigame competition.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   idle     — not started
 *   playing  — human is playing; AI scores are pre-computed
 *   complete — human has submitted a score; winner/lastPlace determined
 *
 * Scoring (lower-is-better / time-based):
 *  - Scores are completion times in milliseconds.
 *  - Lower time = better. Winner = fastest (lowest ms). Last place = slowest (highest ms).
 *  - AI scores are pre-computed via simulateAiPerformance before initTiltLabyrinth
 *    and passed into the slice as aiScores.
 *
 * Authoritative outcome:
 *  - Once the human submits their time, setHumanScore computes winner + lastPlaceId
 *    from all player scores (human + AI). resolveTiltLabyrinthOutcome then dispatches
 *    applyMinigameWinner with the authoritative winner and lastPlaceId.
 *  - outcomeResolved guard prevents double-dispatch.
