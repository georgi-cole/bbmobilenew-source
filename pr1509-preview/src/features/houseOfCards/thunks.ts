/**
 * Thunk: resolveHouseOfCardsOutcome
 *
 * Reads the completed House of Cards competition state, validates the current
 * game phase matches the prize type, and awards LOH or POS via
 * `applyMinigameWinner`.
 *
 * Idempotent — if outcomeResolved is already true it returns immediately
 * without dispatching again. Mirrors the famousFigures/thunks.ts pattern.
 *
 * lastPlaceType is 'scored' because House of Cards derives last place from
 * authoritative Clash Score rankings — never from participant order alone.
