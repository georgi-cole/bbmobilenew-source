/**
 * Thunk: resolveRiskWheelOutcome
 *
 * Reads the completed Risk Wheel state, validates the current game phase
 * matches the competition type, and awards LOH or POS via
 * `applyMinigameWinner`.
 *
 * Mirrors the resolveBlackjackTournamentOutcome pattern:
 *  - Idempotent: no-op if outcomeResolved is already true.
 *  - Phase-guarded: logs an error and returns if the game phase does not
 *    match the competition type (prevents accidental cross-phase dispatch).
 *  - Sets outcomeResolved BEFORE dispatching applyMinigameWinner so any
 *    synchronous re-render triggered by the winner dispatch sees the guard.
