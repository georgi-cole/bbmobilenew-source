/**
 * Fast, synchronous background AI simulation for the Risk Wheel.
 *
 * Runs entirely in-memory without any Redux dispatches so the caller
 * can compute final scores quickly (e.g. before showing the leaderboard)
 * without waiting for the full animated turn loop.
 *
 * The simulation mirrors the logic inside `riskWheelSlice.resolveAllAiTurns`:
 * each AI player spins up to MAX_SPINS_PER_TURN times, applies sector effects,
 * and stops when they decide to bank or when their spins are exhausted.

 * @param seed       Optional deterministic seed. Pass a non-zero value for
 *                   reproducible results. Omit or pass `0` to use a fresh
 *                   crypto-random seed. Both `undefined` and `0` are treated
