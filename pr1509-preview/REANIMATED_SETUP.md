# Animation Setup & Rebuild Guide

## Overview

This project is a **React web application** (Vite + TypeScript), not a React Native app.
All animation components use CSS keyframe animations and React state — no native rebuild
or Babel plugin is required.

> **Note:** The original issue referenced `react-native-reanimated`, but the repository
> is a standard web project. The animation deliverables have been implemented using
> browser-native CSS animations for full compatibility without any native build step.

## New Animation Components

| Component                  | Location                                   | Purpose                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AnimatedVoteResultsModal` | `src/components/AnimatedVoteResultsModal/` | Sequential per-vote reveal, eviction announcement, tie banner |
| `TiebreakerModal`          | `src/components/TiebreakerModal/`          | HOH tie-break UI + AI-HOH countdown                           |
| `NominationAnimator`       | `src/components/NominationAnimator/`       | Full-screen nomination ceremony animation                     |
| `CrownAnimation`           | `src/components/CrownAnimation/`           | HOH/POV winner crown + shine overlay                          |

## Debug Steps

### Verify nomination animation is firing

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Play until you are HOH and reach the nomination ceremony.
3. Select two houseguests and confirm nominees.
4. You should see the full-screen animation overlay (backdrop dims, avatars scale up with ❓ badge).
5. Check the browser console for the log line:
   ```
   NOMINATION_TRIGGERED ['<id1>', '<id2>'] { currentUserIsHoh: true }
   ```

### Dev button

In development builds a gold **"🎬 Dev: Play Nomination Animation"** button appears in the
lower-left corner of the Game screen. Tapping it immediately plays the `NominationAnimator`
for two eligible houseguests without needing to reach the nomination ceremony.

## Running the Project

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run unit tests
npm test

# Type-check
npm run typecheck
```

No CocoaPods, no Android Gradle, no Metro cache — this is a standard web app.

## Using the New Animation Components

### AnimatedVoteResultsModal

```tsx
import AnimatedVoteResultsModal from './components/AnimatedVoteResultsModal/AnimatedVoteResultsModal'
;<AnimatedVoteResultsModal
  nominees={tallies} // VoteTally[]
  evictee={evicteePlayer} // Player | null (null = let component detect tie)
  onTiebreakerRequired={(ids) => dispatch(setTieBreak(ids))}
  onDone={() => dispatch(dismissVoteResults())}
  revealIntervalMs={700} // ms between each vote reveal
  postRevealDelayMs={1000} // ms to wait after last vote
  countdownMs={4000} // countdown before onDone fires
/>
```

### TiebreakerModal

```tsx
import TiebreakerModal from './components/TiebreakerModal/TiebreakerModal'
;<TiebreakerModal
  tiedNominees={tiedPlayers} // Player[]
  isHoh={currentUserIsHoh} // boolean
  onSelect={(id) => dispatch(submitTieBreak(id))}
  countdownSec={3} // AI HOH countdown (seconds)
/>
```

### NominationAnimator

```tsx
import NominationAnimator from './components/NominationAnimator/NominationAnimator'
;<NominationAnimator
  nominees={nominatedPlayers} // Player[]
  onDone={() => setShowNomAnim(false)}
  holdMs={2000} // how long to hold the centred state
/>
```

### CrownAnimation

```tsx
import CrownAnimation from './components/CrownAnimation/CrownAnimation'
;<CrownAnimation
  winner={hohWinnerPlayer} // Player
  label="Head of Household" // competition name
  onDone={() => setShowCrown(false)}
  durationMs={3000} // total display duration before onDone
/>
```

## Accessibility

All new components:

- Include `role="dialog"` or `role="status"` with `aria-label`
- Use `aria-live="assertive"` for dynamic announcements
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` — all CSS animations are disabled via media query
  when the user has requested reduced motion

---

## Testing

```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm test

# Run only the new competition / log tests
npx vitest run tests/competition.test.ts tests/logsReducer.test.ts
```

## QA Checklist

### HOH Competition Guard

- [ ] Play TapRace and submit 0 taps — verify the AI player with the highest score wins HOH, not the 0-tap player
- [ ] All players score 0 (edge case) — a winner is still deterministically selected

### Vote Results — Non-Tie

- [ ] Advance game to `eviction_results` — VoteResultsPopup (or AnimatedVoteResultsModal) shows votes one at a time
- [ ] After last vote, "EVICTED" label appears on the loser
- [ ] Clicking anywhere skips the countdown

### Vote Results — Tie

- [ ] Seed a game where votes tie (use Debug Panel to force nominees and skip to eviction)
- [ ] TiebreakerModal appears
- [ ] Human HOH: two nominee buttons shown; selecting one evicts them
- [ ] AI HOH: countdown displays; after countdown, AI picks an evictee

### Nomination Animation

- [ ] Instantiate `<NominationAnimator nominees={...} onDone={...} />` in a test page
- [ ] Backdrop dims, avatar scales to centre with ❓ badge
- [ ] After holdMs, avatar returns and onDone fires

### Crown Animation

- [ ] Instantiate `<CrownAnimation winner={...} label="Head of Household" onDone={...} />`
- [ ] Crown scales in, wobbles, shine sweep plays
- [ ] After durationMs, onDone fires

### TV Log — Replacement Nominee

- [ ] Trigger a veto save + AI HOH replacement — verify the replacement-nom entry has a unique ID
- [ ] New events push the replacement-nom entry down the log (no pinning)

### Reduced Motion

- [ ] Set OS/browser to "prefers-reduced-motion: reduce"
- [ ] All animations are suppressed; content is still visible
