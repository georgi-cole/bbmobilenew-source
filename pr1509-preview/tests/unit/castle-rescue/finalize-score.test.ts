/**
 * tests/unit/castle-rescue/finalize-score.test.ts
 *
 * Tests for computePlatformerFinalScore:
 *  - Preserves gs.score (does not double-count penalties already applied in-run).
 *  - Subtracts floor(elapsedMs/1000) × TIME_PENALTY_PER_SECOND from the score.
 *  - Adds RESCUE_BONUS when princessRescued is true.
 *  - Score is clamped to 0 (never negative).
 *  - Sub-second elapsed time is floored before applying time penalty.
