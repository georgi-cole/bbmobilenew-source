/**
 * socialMiddleware — Redux middleware that hooks the SocialEngine into the
 * game phase lifecycle and dispatches social resource deltas for game events.
 *
 * Listens for:
 *   - game/setPhase              (explicit phase override, e.g. from DebugPanel)
 *   - game/forcePhase            (dev-only forced transition)
 *   - game/advance               (normal gameplay phase progression)
 *   - game/completeMinigame      (LOH/POS winner from tap-race; zero-score penalty)
 *   - game/applyMinigameWinner   (LOH/POS winner from challenge flow)
 *   - game/skipMinigame          (competition skipped: -3 energy to all alive)
 *   - game/submitPovSaveTarget   (POS holder saves a nominee: +2 energy to saved player)
 *   - social/updateRelationship  (relationship/twin propagation only; calibrated
 *                                 resource transitions live in relationshipResourcePolicyMiddleware)
 *
 * Event delta rules:
 *   LOH win               → +5  energy to winner
 *   POS win               → +6  energy to winner
 *   Survived nomination   → +4  energy to remaining nominees (entering live_vote)
 *   Saved by POS          → +2  energy to saved player
 *   Competition skipped   → -3  energy to all alive players
 *   Zero score (minigame) → -2  energy to the scoring player
