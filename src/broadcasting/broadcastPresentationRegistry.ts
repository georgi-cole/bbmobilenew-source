 * This registry intentionally does not duplicate the P0 editorial contract:
 * editorial metadata still owns log_only/ambient/foreground/interrupt routing,
 * optional budgets and Force-to-TV precedence. These rules only describe how a
 * recognised major announcement is rendered once it reaches the Faux TV.
 *
 * `eventMajor` preserves the exact legacy TvZone whitelist. Some entries carry
 * announcement/shock/play-through metadata without being accepted as generic
 * event majors because they are reached only through bespoke or managed flows.
